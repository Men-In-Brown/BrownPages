    "Thymeleaf is a spring-integrated way to easily make pages that can integrate seamlessly with API calls. It allows you to easily list out what is needed from each of your SQL tables without needing to make a direct request. An extremely beneficial aspect of thymeleaf is the ability to also create an admin panel, which allows you to perform CRUD operations. \n",
