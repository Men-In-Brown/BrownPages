You will write three static methods, all of which are in a single enclosing class, named DiverseArray (not shown). The first method returns the sum of the values of a one-dimensional array; the second method returns an array that represents the sums of the rows of a two-dimensional array; and the third method analyzes row sums.\n",

The method has one parameter, a two-dimensional array arr2D of int values. The array is in row-major order: arr2D [ r ] [ c ] is the entry at row r and column c. The method returns a one-dimensional array with one entry for each row of arr2D such that each entry is the sum of the corresponding row in arr2D. As a reminder, each row of a two-dimensional array is a one-dimensional array.\n",

    "- **Question 1**: We apply the concept of 2D arrays in our database. We use CRUD mapping methods in our backend code and treat the database like a 2D array, manipulating the different elements per their row and column. Specific to the question, we use the diversity method from Question 1 in our database when we compare different rows. Although we are not comparing the sum of our rows, we are comparing the different values of rows, for purposes such as login or storing company info.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Question 2**: In our database, each company has a property called \"investments\", which is an ArrayList in the backend. Similar to the algorithm used in Question 2, we parse through the investments property when we want to display that data in our frontend or admin panel, as well as when we want to manipulate the data via CRUD operations.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Question 3**: Similar to how the algorithms in Question 3 either get a value at a row or column or remove, we use GetMapping and DeleteMapping annotations for our company and employee/user database."

    "- Don't forget that for loop parameters need to be boolean statements. \"i == 10\" is valid, but \"i = 10\" is not.\n",
    "\n",
    "- For for loop parameters, don't use \"<=\" especially for lists, just use \"<\".\n",
    "\n",
    "- In the rowSums() method, I did ```int[] sums;```, but next time, I must initialize it. The way I shall do it: ```int[] sums = new int[arr2D.length];```. \n",
    "\n",
    "- The \"length\" property of a 2D array returns how many rows it has. If I wanted the number of columns, I would do ```array2D[row].length;```, to get the number of columns at any row. If the 2D array is uniform, each row should have the same number of columns.\n",
    "\n",
    "- I did this once perfectly already, but usually, more complex methods build of previously simpler ones. I can use that to my advantage for efficiency.\n",
    "\n",
    "- For checking if an array has two or more variables, I can iterate through the list with two indexes by using a nested for loop, where the outside for loop has an ```int i``` iterating as it normally would, and an ```int j = i + 1;``` that starts off one index after int ```i```.\n",
    "- Although you can consider Strings as char arrays, you have to use the ```toCharArray()``` method to do the conversion, then treat it like a char array.\n",
    "- Study the code of how to convert an ```ArrayList<String>``` to a char array, you may need it depending on if you're allowed to do it.\n",
    "- Instead of returning an initialized String variable when dealing with strings, create a new instance of String with the parameter as the char array you may have created, assuming you are dealing with a similar question.\n",
    "- Pay attention to the use of ArrayLists. If you're gonna use ArrayLists, don't use regular list operations or methods. Instead of arr[index], use arr.get().\n",
