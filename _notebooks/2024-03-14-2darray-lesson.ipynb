    "For **Methods & Control Structures** questions, here are the steps we recommend:\n",

    "- Write a quick list of M&CT you know to remind yourself:\n",
    "    - Void methods\n",
    "    - Non-void methods\n",
    "        - Most of the time, all methods are already defined, you just have to write them\n",
    "    - For loops\n",
    "    - While loops\n",
    "    - Conditional statements\n",
    "    - Nested loops\n",
    "    - Nested conditionals\n",
    "    - Switch/case\n",
    "        - I wouldn't count on using this\n",
    "- Map out your code using basic diagrams as pseudo code\n",
    "    - As you go, check off M&CT off of your list whenever you use them\n",
    "        - Remember that they can be used more than once\n",
    "    - Try going into a bit more detail when you start applying the M&CT to your pseudo code\n",
    "- Write your code out (yes, it is in pen)\n",
    "    - Remember to have a mental debugger\n",
    "        - If you need practice, do the debugging event lesson again and play around with different breakpoints, errors, etc.\n",
    "\n",
    "For M&CT questions that involve **2D Arrays**, here are the steps we recommend:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Establish what the question is asking:\n",
    "    - Almost always, the question requires you to iterate through the list.\n",
    "    - Then, either search for something, count up elements, or manipulate certain elements that you parse through.\n",
    "- Use the steps from methods & control structures to map out (with pseudo-code) exactly what you're going to do with the 2D array.\n",
    "    - Remember to always keep a mental debugger active\n",
    "    - If you're not sure about a certain line of code, it's the perfect opportunity to literally add a breakpoint in your code.\n",
    "    - Treat breakpoints in your code as a \"mark for review\" symbol. \n"
