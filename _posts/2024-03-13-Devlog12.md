# Devlog Update


Right now, we have 3 separate projects that all need to be integrated with one another. Thus, today we have divided into three groups in order to get work done while still allowing for time to work on our Wednesday lesson


## Group 1: Parav, Sharay, Paaras: Frontend/Saturn integration

This group will be working on making the frontend look unified between our three projects, ensuring that we have a ready frontend for integration and out backend to be added onto our projects immediately.

Sharay/Paaras: Getting the frontend
Parav: JWT integration onto the frontend (acct system)

## Group 2: Tanay and Varalu

This group will focus on roles and adding roles to the account system. This is to ensure only certain people can access certain information

Tanay/Varalu: RBAC 

## Group 3: Colin/Soham

This group will make quizzes and assignments as well as grades

Colin: Assignments and quizzes inheritance
Soham: Grades and grade management

## Group 4: Aniket, Orlando, Mati

This group will work on the chatting feature.
