# Devlog: Core Features Development
## Date: April 15, 2024

### Project Overview
Today's focus was on multiple core features for our educational application: **Grades, Flashcards, Login, and Account Management**. These are fundamental parts of our application, serving both educators and students. The goal is to ensure these features are completed efficiently, within a week, and meet our high standards of quality.

### Goal for the Week
The goal for this week is to complete the development and integration of all four major features: Grades, Flashcards, Login, and Account Management. Each of these features requires distinct skills and focus areas, so the team has been divided to ensure a smooth workflow.

### Team Assignments
The following team members have been assigned to work on the specific tasks:

- **Grades**
  - **Tanay and Shaurya**: Tanay is responsible for the frontend UI, ensuring the grades tab is user-friendly and intuitive. Shaurya is handling the backend, setting up the database schema for storing grades and creating API endpoints for retrieval and updates.

- **Flashcards**
  - **Paaras, Mati, and Soham**: Paaras is leading the frontend development, building the interface for creating and using flashcards. Mati and Soham are working on backend integration, ensuring the data is securely stored and accessible.

- **Login**
  - **Colin and Orlando**: Colin is responsible for the frontend, creating the login page and managing user authentication. Orlando is handling backend authentication, ensuring security and implementing OAuth for third-party login options.

- **Account Management**
  - **Varaprasad, Aniket, and Parav**: Varaprasad is in charge of frontend development, building the account management interface. Aniket and Parav are handling backend functionality, ensuring users can update their profiles, change passwords, and manage account settings.

### Development Progress
- **April 14, 2024**: The team met to plan the week's tasks. Each group presented their initial designs and discussed potential integration challenges. The backend team outlined the database schema and API endpoints required for each feature.

- **April 15, 2024**: Development work began in earnest. 
  - For the **Grades** tab, Tanay started building the frontend components, focusing on a clear and informative layout. Shaurya worked on setting up the database schema for grades and creating API endpoints to retrieve and update grades.
  - For the **Flashcards** tab, Paaras worked on the frontend structure, creating a simple and flexible interface for flashcard creation and use. Mati and Soham began integrating backend storage and retrieval for flashcards.
  - For the **Login** tab, Colin implemented the basic login page and user authentication flow, while Orlando started setting up OAuth for third-party logins.
  - For **Account Management**, Varaprasad created the basic UI, allowing users to view and update their profile information. Aniket and Parav worked on backend functions for updating user details and handling password changes.

### Upcoming Tasks
- **Grades**: Tanay and Shaurya will continue developing the frontend and backend components, focusing on seamless data retrieval and user interactions.
- **Flashcards**: Paaras will work on adding functionality for creating, editing, and deleting flashcards, while Mati and Soham ensure secure backend storage and retrieval.
- **Login**: Colin will implement additional authentication features like password reset, while Orlando integrates OAuth with third-party login providers.
- **Account Management**: Varaprasad will add features for updating profile pictures and account settings, while Aniket and Parav work on backend security and user data management.

### Challenges and Concerns
- **Data Security**: Given the sensitive nature of user data, security is a top priority. The backend team is focusing on ensuring all data is encrypted and secure, especially for login and account management.
- **User Experience**: All features must be user-friendly and intuitive. The frontend team is working on creating simple and effective interfaces to enhance user experience.
- **Integration**: Integration between different components is crucial. The team is coordinating to ensure smooth interaction between frontend and backend elements.

### Conclusion
With a dedicated team and a clear plan, we're on track to complete the development of Grades, Flashcards, Login, and Account Management within one week. Each feature plays a crucial role in our educational application, and we're committed to delivering high-quality results on time. We'll continue to monitor progress and address any challenges to ensure a successful outcome.
